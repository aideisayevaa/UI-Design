With its light brown color, creamy texture, and sweet flavor, milk chocolate is widely regarded as the most popular type of chocolate. It is made by combining chocolate liquor (cocoa solids and cocoa butter) with sugar, and milk. Sometimes an emulsifier, such as soy lecithin, is added to enhance its smoothness. According to the FDA definition, milk chocolate must contain at least 10% chocolate liquor and 12% milk.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0322\/2047\/9621\/files\/product2.jpg?v=1581876389\" alt=\"\"\u003e \u003c\/a\u003e\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e","brand":"Chokolade | Chocolate Sweets \u0026 Candy And Cake Shopify Theme","offers":[{"title":"8 piece \/ Chocolate","offer_id":32267656364165,"sku":"","price":12.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"12 piece \/ Chocolate","offer_id":32267656396933,"sku":"","price":15.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0322\/2047\/9621\/products\/12.1.jpg?v=1581911754","url":"https:\/\/chokolade-store-demo.myshopify.com\/products\/milk-chocolate-cashew-caramel","provider":"Chokolade | Chocolate Sweets \u0026 Candy And Cake Shopify Theme","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
